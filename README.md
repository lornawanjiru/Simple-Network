# Simple-Network
This is a peer to peer network configuration.
I have used eNSP Simulator application to configure the two hosts.
Given the hosts their IP addresses and Subnet mask.


This is mainly a breif tutorial as to how Network professions use github to ensure that configurations are at per with their collegues.

I will be using this platform to also do my own networking and security configuations as well as putting my scripts so feel free to ask me anything and contribute.
